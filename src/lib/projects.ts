The process begins with merging movie ratings and movie details into a unified dataframe, followed by an Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to explore rating patterns and identify top movies. The core model is built using Singular Value Decomposition (SVD), a collaborative filtering algorithm implemented with the surprise library, to predict user ratings. The systemâ€™s performance is rigorously tested through cross-validation, ensuring accuracy and robustness. This notebook provides a practical example of building, training, and evaluating a recommendation model from start to finish.",
